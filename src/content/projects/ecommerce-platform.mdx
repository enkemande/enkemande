## Project Overview

The E-Commerce Platform represents a comprehensive, production-ready solution for handling complex retail operations. Built from the ground up with scalability and reliability in mind, this platform processes millions of transactions annually while maintaining exceptional performance.

## Key Features

### Real-time Inventory Management

The system tracks product inventory across multiple warehouses with sub-second latency using Redis caching and optimistic locking strategies.

- Automatic stock level synchronization
- Low stock alerts
- Multi-warehouse support
- Inventory forecasting

### Payment Integration

Secure payment processing with Stripe ensures PCI compliance and supports multiple payment methods.

```typescript
async function processPayment(orderId: string, amount: number) {
  const payment = await stripe.paymentIntents.create({
    amount,
    currency: 'usd',
    metadata: { orderId },
  });
  return payment;
}
```

### Admin Dashboard

A powerful administrative interface built with React and TypeScript provides insights into sales, customer behavior, and operational metrics.

- Real-time analytics
- Order management
- Customer insights
- Reporting and exports

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend Stack
- **Framework**: Next.js 15 with App Router
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: React Context + Server Components

### Backend Stack
- **Runtime**: Node.js
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- **Caching**: Redis for sessions and inventory
- **API**: RESTful with OpenAPI documentation

### Infrastructure
- **Hosting**: AWS with CloudFront CDN
- **Database**: PostgreSQL RDS with read replicas
- **Storage**: S3 for product images
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch with custom dashboards

## Performance Metrics

- **Page Load Time**: < 2.5s (Core Web Vitals)
- **API Response Time**: < 200ms (p95)
- **Database Query Time**: < 50ms (p95)
- **Uptime**: 99.95%

## Challenges & Solutions

### Handling Peak Traffic
During peak shopping seasons, we implemented horizontal scaling with load balancing and database read replicas to maintain performance.

### Inventory Accuracy
Real-time inventory proved challenging with concurrent orders. We solved this using database-level locking and a queue-based processing system for order fulfillment.

### Payment Reliability
Integration with multiple payment providers and fallback mechanisms ensured payment processing reliability during outages.

## Results & Impact

This platform has become the backbone of the company's e-commerce operations, enabling:
- 10x increase in transaction throughput
- 40% reduction in checkout time
- 99.95% uptime over the past 2 years
- Support for $2M+ in monthly transactions
