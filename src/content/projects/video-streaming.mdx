## Project Overview

The Video Streaming Platform provides a scalable infrastructure for delivering video content to millions of concurrent users. The platform employs industry-standard streaming technologies and optimization techniques.

## Key Features

### Adaptive Bitrate Streaming
- HLS (HTTP Live Streaming) for iOS and Safari
- DASH (Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP) for other platforms
- Automatic quality selection based on bandwidth
- Smooth transitions between quality levels

### Content Management
- Video upload and processing pipeline
- Automatic transcoding to multiple formats
- Metadata management
- Content organization and categorization

### Recommendation Engine
- Collaborative filtering for personalized recommendations
- Content-based recommendations
- Trending content algorithms
- User preference learning

### User Experience
- Seamless playback across devices
- Watch history and resume functionality
- Custom playlists
- Social sharing features

## Technical Architecture

### Streaming Infrastructure
- CloudFront CDN for global content delivery
- Elemental MediaConvert for video transcoding
- S3 for storage with intelligent tiering
- CloudWatch for monitoring

### Backend Services
- Node.js microservices architecture
- PostgreSQL for metadata
- Redis for caching and session management
- Kafka for event streaming

### Frontend
- React with TypeScript
- Video.js for player implementation
- Server-side rendering for performance
- Progressive enhancement for offline support

## Performance Metrics

- **Startup Time**: < 2 seconds
- **Quality Switch Time**: < 500ms
- **Concurrent Users**: 100k+
- **Monthly Streams**: 500M+
- **Availability**: 99.99%

## Streaming Protocol Deep Dive

### HLS Implementation
HLS segments video into small chunks (typically 10 seconds) and uses playlists to manage playback.

```plaintext
#EXTM3U
#EXT-X-VERSION:3
#EXT-X-TARGETDURATION:10
#EXTINF:10.0,
segment-1.ts
#EXTINF:10.0,
segment-2.ts
#EXT-X-ENDLIST
```

### DASH Implementation
DASH uses Media Presentation Description (MPD) XML format for manifest and supports more adaptive strategies.

## Scaling Challenges & Solutions

### Concurrent User Load
Implemented horizontal scaling with load balancers and auto-scaling groups to handle traffic spikes.

### Content Delivery Latency
Multi-region CDN with edge locations ensures users receive content from nearby servers.

### Storage Optimization
Intelligent tiering moves infrequently accessed content to cheaper storage while keeping popular content readily available.

## Results & Impact

The platform successfully streams over 500M videos monthly, supporting millions of concurrent users globally with minimal latency and high availability.
