## Overview

The Real-time Chat App demonstrates modern web technologies for building interactive communication platforms. The application prioritizes security, performance, and user experience.

## Core Features

### Real-time Messaging
Instant message delivery using WebSocket connections with Socket.io ensures users receive messages with minimal latency.

### End-to-End Encryption
Messages are encrypted on the client side using TweetNaCl.js before transmission, ensuring privacy even from server administrators.

### User Authentication
Secure JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens provides a robust security model.

### Message History
Persistent storage of messages in MongoDB allows users to retrieve conversation history across sessions and devices.

### User Presence
Real-time presence indicators show which users are online and when they're typing.

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend
- React with TypeScript for type safety
- Socket.io client for real-time communication
- End-to-end encryption with TweetNaCl.js
- React Query for state management

### Backend
- Node.js with Express server
- Socket.io for WebSocket management
- MongoDB for persistent storage
- JWT for authentication

### Security
- HTTPS/WSS for encrypted transport
- JWT token rotation
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting on API endpoints

## Performance Optimizations

- Connection pooling for database
- Message pagination for efficient history loading
- Lazy loading of user avatars
- Client-side message caching

## Lessons Learned

- WebSocket connection management at scale requires careful attention to memory leaks
- End-to-end encryption adds significant complexity but is essential for privacy
- Real-time features benefit greatly from comprehensive error handling and fallback mechanisms
