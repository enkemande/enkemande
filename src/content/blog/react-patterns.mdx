## Introduction

React has evolved significantly over the years. Modern React patterns focus on performance, maintainability, and developer experience. Let's explore the patterns that define contemporary React development.

## Hooks and Custom Hooks

React Hooks revolutionized how we write components by enabling state and side effects in functional components.

### useCallback for Performance

```javascript
const memoizedCallback = useCallback(
  (a) => {
    doSomething(a);
  },
  [a],
);
```

Use `useCallback` to memoize functions that are passed as dependencies to other hooks or used as event handlers.

### useMemo for Expensive Computations

```javascript
const memoizedValue = useMemo(
  () => computeExpensiveValue(a, b),
  [a, b]
);
```

Cache expensive computations and avoid recalculating them on every render.

## Concurrent Rendering

React's concurrent features allow the library to interrupt long renders to keep the application responsive.

### Suspense

Suspense lets your components "wait" for something before rendering.

```javascript
<Suspense fallback={<Loading />}>
  <LazyComponent />
</Suspense>
```

## Server Components

React Server Components allow rendering components on the server and streaming the result to the client.

```javascript
// This runs only on the server
async function BlogPosts() {
  const posts = await fetch('https://...');
  return <BlogPostList posts={posts} />;
}
```

## Performance Best Practices

- Keep components small and focused
- Use code splitting and lazy loading
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders with memoization
- Optimize images and assets
- Use a production build for deployment

## Conclusion

Modern React development is about understanding the tools available and using them appropriately. Focus on user experience, maintain clean code, and always measure performance improvements.
