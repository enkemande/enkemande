## Introduction

A well-crafted design system serves as the backbone of consistent user interfaces across your organization. This guide explores the principles and practices that make design systems truly scalable.

## Core Components of a Design System

### Design Tokens

Define design tokens as the atomic units of your design system.

```javascript
const tokens = {
  colors: {
    primary: '#0066CC',
    secondary: '#FF6B6B',
  },
  spacing: {
    xs: '4px',
    sm: '8px',
    md: '16px',
    lg: '24px',
  },
  typography: {
    heading: {
      fontSize: '32px',
      fontWeight: '700',
    },
  },
};
```

### Component Library

Build a library of reusable components that implement your design tokens.

- Button
- Input
- Card
- Modal
- Navigation

## Documentation

Comprehensive documentation is critical for adoption.

- Component stories with Storybook
- Usage guidelines and best practices
- Accessibility considerations
- Code examples

## Scaling Across Teams

As your design system grows, ensure:

- Clear governance and contribution guidelines
- Version management and breaking change communication
- Regular updates and refinements based on feedback
- Training and onboarding for new team members

## Accessibility First

Design systems must be accessible by default.

- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Keyboard navigation support
- Proper color contrast ratios
- Semantic HTML structure

## Conclusion

A robust design system accelerates development, improves consistency, and creates a shared language across teams. Invest in its foundation early and evolve it based on real-world usage patterns.
