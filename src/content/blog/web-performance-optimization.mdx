## Introduction

Web performance is critical for user experience and SEO. This guide covers actionable strategies to optimize your web applications.

## Core Web Vitals

Google's Core Web Vitals measure user experience across three key areas:

### 1. Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)
- Measures visual completeness
- Target: < 2.5 seconds
- Optimize: Images, fonts, lazy loading

### 2. First Input Delay (FID)
- Measures interactivity
- Target: < 100 milliseconds
- Optimize: JavaScript execution, long tasks

### 3. Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)
- Measures visual stability
- Target: < 0.1
- Optimize: Reserve space, avoid unsized media

## Performance Optimization Techniques

### Code Splitting

```typescript
// Dynamic imports for route-based splitting
const Dashboard = dynamic(() => import('./Dashboard'), {
  loading: () => <LoadingSpinner />,
});
```

### Image Optimization

- Use next/image component
- Serve appropriate sizes
- Use modern formats (WebP)
- Implement lazy loading

### JavaScript Bundling

- Minimize main bundle
- Remove unused code
- Tree-shake dependencies
- Compress assets

## Monitoring Performance

Implement performance monitoring tools:
- Web Vitals API
- Google Analytics
- Lighthouse CI
- Custom metrics

## Caching Strategies

- Browser caching
- CDN caching
- Service worker caching
- API response caching

## Conclusion

Prioritizing performance optimization creates better user experiences and improves SEO rankings. Monitor continuously and iterate based on real user data.
